Completed coding challenges for the Aiden Lab

General:

• I used Python to complete the coding challenges.
1A Bucket Challenge:
• I decided to solve this problem using recursion, because the recursive solution was very
concise and intuitive. However, this does have its drawbacks—you will need to be wary of the target values you input into this file, as large values will exceed the maximum recursion depth in Python.
• You can pass arguments at the call line.
The input array of bucket values should be a string of integers separated by commas (e.g. 5,4,6 or 23,56,78 or 1,2,3,4,5,6 or ...). In other words, there should be no spaces separating values in the array.
The input target value should simply be an integer (e.g. 4 or 7 or 321 or ...).
For example, the following was displayed in my terminal:
